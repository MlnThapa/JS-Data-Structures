Linked List:
- A Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.
- Each node consist of a data value and a pointer that points to a next node.
- The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of
  the entire structure.
- Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity.

The linked list data structure supports three main operations:
 - Insertion - to add an element at the begining, end or at given index in the list.
 - Deletion - to remove an item given its index or value.
 - Search - to find an element given its value.

Linked List Usage:
- All applications of both stacks and queues are applications of linked list.
  example - Image viewer.
