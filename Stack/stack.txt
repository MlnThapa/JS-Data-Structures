Stack:
- The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of 
  Lsst In First Out(LIFO)
- The last element is inserted into the stack is first element to be removed.
- A stack of plates. The last plate placedon top of the stack is the first to be removed.
  form the stack.
- Stack is abstract data type. It is defined by behaviour rather than being a mathematical model.
- The Stack data structure supports two main operations
    - Push, which adds an element to the collection.
    - Pop, which removes the most recently addded element from the collection.

Stack usge:
- Browser history tracking.

Stack implementation:
- push(element) - add an element to the top of the stack.
- pop() - remove the top element from the stack.
- peek() - get the value of the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty() - check if the stack is empty.
- size() - get the number of elements in the stack.
- print() - visualize the element in the stack.
